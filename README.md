# Loan-Default-Prediction

### This project aims to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of loan default. By analyzing historical loan data, including borrower characteristics, financial information, and previous payment history, the model predicts whether a loan will default or not. With the help of machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, this model helps financial institutions assess the credit risk associated with lending, enabling smarter and more informed decision-making to mitigate financial loss.

#### Key Features:
##### Loan Details: loan_amnt, term, int_rate, installment, annual_inc
##### Credit Information: dti, loan_status, revol_bal, revol_util
##### Demographics & History: address, pub_rec, mort_acc, earliest_cr_line
##### Loan Purpose & Status: purpose, application_type, verification_status
## Goal:
##### The model predicts loan repayment status (loan_repaid) to assist in smarter lending decisions.
